      <li>1. Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
      <p>Object-oriented programming is important because it organizes code into reusable and modular components. It models real-world things as objects, making programs easier to read, maintain, and expand.</p>
      <li>2. In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
how this type of object can help us in software development.</li>
      <p>AccountType is a static object that stores predefined account types like "Normal" or "Saving". It helps keep the program consistent and error-free by avoiding repeated string values.</p>
      <li>3. Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?
Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.</li>
      <p>Encapsulation hides internal details of a class to prevent outside code from breaking it. Private members use # and can only be accessed inside the class, while public members are accessible outside. This keeps code safe and organized.</p>
      <li>4. Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.</li>
      <p>The new command creates a new object from a class. It runs the constructor, sets up properties and methods, and returns a usable object instance.</p>
