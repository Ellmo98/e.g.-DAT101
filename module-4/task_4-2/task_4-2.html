      <li>What is an array?</li>
      <p>An array is a data structure that stores multiple values in a single variable, where each value is accessed using an index.</p>
       <li>What does “hardcoding” mean?</li>
      <p>Hardcoding means writing fixed values directly into the source code instead of generating or receiving them dynamically from user input, files, or other sources.</p>
       <li>Explain task 3 and how we traverse an array when we don’t know its length</li>
      <p>In task 3, a text string is split into an array of words. To traverse the array without knowing its length, we use a loop that runs from index 0 up to array.length - 1. This allows the program to automatically adapt to the size of the array.</p>
       <li>Why is it beneficial to store class instances in arrays?</li>
      <p>Storing class instances in arrays makes it easy to manage, loop through, sort, and manipulate many objects of the same type, such as books, users, or products.</p>
      <li>Explain the EWeekDays object</li>
      <p>EWeekDays is an object that groups related weekday values. The value attribute represents the actual string value of a day. WeekDay represents a single day, Workdays is a collection of weekdays, and Weekends contains weekend days.
A WorkoutDays element could look like an array containing "Monday", "Wednesday", and "Thursday".</p>
