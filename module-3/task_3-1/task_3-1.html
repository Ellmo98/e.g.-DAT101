      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>If wake-up time is exactly 7, the program prints that you can take the bus.
If wake-up time is not 7, nothing is printed because there is no else yet.
</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>If wake-up time is 7, you can take the bus.
If wake-up time is not 7, the else triggers and you must take the car.
</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>If wake-up time is 7, you take the bus.
If wake-up time is 8, you take the train.
Any other wake-up time (less than 7 or greater than 8) results in taking the car.
</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>If the value is positive, it prints “Positive”.
If the value is negative, it prints “Negative”.
If the value is 0, it is treated as “Negative” because zero is not greater than zero,
even though zero is actually neither positive nor negative.
